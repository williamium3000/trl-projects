"""Cross-supervised GRPO with data-parallel split: each group trains one model.

N≥2 accelerate worlds run in parallel (group A on CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0..,
group B on next slice, group C ..., each on disjoint GPUs). Each group is a
standard `GRPOTrainer` with a single override: `_calculate_rewards` computes
this group's pseudo-labels, exchanges them with the *other N-1* groups via a
file rendezvous, then injects a single supervision label per prompt:

  - 2-way (N=2): the peer's pseudo-label IS the supervision.
  - N-way (N≥3): majority-vote over the N-1 peer pseudo-labels. **Ties (no
    strict majority) → UNLABELED**, matching TODO §5.3 "平票丢弃" protocol.

This override is the *only* coupling between groups. Generation, forward,
backward, and DS->vLLM weight sync all happen independently inside each
group, so the groups run in genuine parallel across disjoint GPUs.
