"""File-based rendezvous for exchanging pseudo-labels between co-grpo-dp groups.

Each group runs in its own accelerate world (different CUDA devices, different
master port). They share nothing at the `torch.distributed` level; cross-group
communication is done exclusively by writing and polling JSON files in a
shared directory on the filesystem.

Two protocols:

  - `exchange()` — 2-way (legacy). One outgoing file per call:
        <dir>/<mode>_<counter>_<me>.json
    Consumer deletes peer's file after read.

  - `exchange_n_way()` — N-way (N ≥ 2). One outgoing file per peer:
        <dir>/<mode>_<counter>_from-<me>_to-<peer>.json
    Each consumer only deletes its OWN incoming file — no cross-consumer race.
    This is the protocol used by 3+ way co-grpo-dp (e.g. N=3 Qwen × Llama × Gemma).

The N-way protocol is a strict superset of 2-way; we keep `exchange()` for
backward compatibility with existing 2-way scripts.

Only one rank per group should call exchange* (typically `accelerator.is_main_process`).
The caller is responsible for broadcasting the returned payload to the rest of the group.
