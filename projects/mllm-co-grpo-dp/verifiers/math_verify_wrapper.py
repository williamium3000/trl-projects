"""Grading wrapper for mllm-co-grpo-dp (qwen-sympy backend).

Originally designed around HuggingFace `math_verify` (the grader R1-V
baseline uses). CPU verification on 2026-05-15 surfaced two issues that
made math_verify unsuitable for this project:

1. `verify(parse("\\sqrt{2}\\pi"), parse("\\sqrt{2}\\pi"))` returns
   `False` (self-fail on irrational products) — produces false-negative
   rewards on geometry answers containing `\\sqrt` and `\\pi`.
2. `latex2sympy2_extended` (math_verify dep) pins antlr4 4.13.2, which
   conflicts with the antlr4 4.7.2 pinned by `latex2sympy2` in the marti
   env. Installing math_verify into the shared marti env broke marti.

Switched to the qwen-sympy grader (`verifiers.qwen.math_grade.grade_answer`),
which is the same grader used by co-grpo-dp / co-grpo / un-grpo-maj / grpo.
It bakes in:
  - Hendrycks-MATH string normalization (tfrac→frac, \\text{}, etc.)
  - LaTeX → sympy equivalence (\\frac{1}{2} == 0.5)
  - Unit word stripping (`degree`, `cm`, `meter`, …) and `^\\circ`
  - Tuple/list element-wise equality with fraction-reduction guards

⚠️ Unicode `°` is NOT covered by qwen's `_normalize` (only the LaTeX
`^\\circ` form and the word `degree` are). GEOQA pseudo-labels and model
completions both use the raw `°` character, so this wrapper pre-strips it
before delegating to qwen. Same for the raw `π` character.

Three callers share this module, mirroring co-grpo-dp's three-way design:

1. `_majority_vote` in `co_label_utils.py` (uses `normalize_answer` as a
   fast hash key for clustering, no sympy cost).
2. `reward_correctness` in `train_mllm_co_grpo_dp.py` (uses `grade_answer`
   for true math equivalence — robust to format diffs in peer pseudo-labels).
3. `mllm_co_grpo_dp_trainer._calculate_rewards` eval-mode short-circuit
   (delegates to parent reward path, so eval accuracy uses the same
   `grade_answer` against the dataset's ground-truth solution).

File name kept as `math_verify_wrapper.py` for backwards compatibility with
upstream imports (`co_label_utils.py`, `dataset.py`). The public surface
(`extract_answer_tag`, `normalize_answer`, `grade_answer`) is stable.
