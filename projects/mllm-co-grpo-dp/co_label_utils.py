"""Answer extraction + grading + majority-vote for mllm-co-grpo-dp.

Mirrors `co-grpo-dp/co_label_utils.py` but with two substitutions:

1. **Extractor**: `<answer>...</answer>` tags (R1-V baseline) instead of
   `\\boxed{}` (qwen-math convention).
2. **Grader**: `math_verify` (HuggingFace official, identical to R1-V
   baseline) instead of the qwen-sympy verifier.

Function names (`extract_boxed_answer`, `normalize_answer`,
`_extract_and_normalize`, `_majority_vote`, `_UNLABELED_SENTINEL`,
`grade_answer`) are kept identical to co-grpo-dp's so that
`mllm_co_grpo_dp_trainer.py` and `train_mllm_co_grpo_dp.py` can mirror
the co-grpo-dp counterparts line-by-line (repo root `CLAUDE.md`:
"consistency over correctness" — duplicated code stays aligned even
when internals differ).

The 4-regime reward (`compute_4regime_reward`) from co-grpo-dp is **NOT**
included here: per `mllm_co_grpo_dp_plan` memory the mllm project does
only binary cross-supervision (no 4regime / disagree / naive variants).

    Args:

            ``None`` means the rollout did not produce a parseable answer.
        threshold (`float`):
            Minimum top-answer frequency (over parseable answers) to accept

        no rollout parses.

    Note: clustering uses string identity on canonicalized answers, NOT
    semantic equivalence. This is fast (microseconds vs ~1-10ms per
    math_verify parse) and relies on the simple normalizer upstream.
    The downstream reward function (`reward_correctness`) does use
    math_verify semantic equivalence, so any miss here is recovered at
